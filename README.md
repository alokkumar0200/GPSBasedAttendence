# GPS Based Attendance System

## Features
* Multiple Organizations can be added, and each can be viewed by its own seperate subdomain
* Organization owner can set the radius of office to mark the area
* To mark the attendance employee/student or any HUMAN has to be present in within the marked perimeter
* Organization can mark half-day or leave timings based on late login or early logout
* If forgot to login/logout, HUMAN can send for review which can be approved or denied by the admin
* Overall attendance can be reviewed by the admin
* And few other features like sending notification to HUMANS using the app

## Android App provided is just a PoC, it somehow manages to work
## Maybe in future if I get time, I will upload one documentation for API Usage
